# A Letter
<br> Dear Kira, <br>
<br> You are not a fleeting dream. You are not a passing season. You are the story I wish to tell until the end of my days.<br><br> I do not love you because of what the world sees; I love you for the infinite universe that lives within you — for your laughter, which heals; for your kindness, which teaches; for your presence, which steadies.<br><br> With you, even silence is music, even stillness is poetry. This love is not shallow; it is an ocean. Its tides rise with every heartbeat, and even when the surface is still, beneath it lives a depth that no storm can shake.<br>
  <br> Sure there still will be storms; there will be seasons we cannot predict. There will be mornings when neither of us is our best self. Yet even then, I vow to return — to return to your side, to return to your truths, to return to the work of loving you. I will not abandon the difficult days in search of only the easy ones, because the difficult days are where promises prove their mettle. <br>
  <br> I promise you this: I will not only love you on the easy days, when the skies are clear and the air is sweet. I will love you in the storms, when thunder shakes the ground and shadows fall. I will hold your hand when it trembles, and lift your head when it bows. I will remind you of your strength when you forget, and of your light when the world feels dim.<br>
  <br> There will be days when the world asks too much of us, when patience wears thin and words grow blunt. On those days, I promise to listen twice as much as I speak, to make room for your truth. Love is not only celebratory; it is the careful work of repair, the steady choosing to heal instead of to flee.<br>
  <br> My love is not fragile. It is not a candle that flickers in the wind. It is a fire carved into stone, a vow written into the marrow of my being, an eternity carried in every heartbeat.<br>
  <br> I will be the quiet companion of your grief and the loudest witness of your joy. I will plant trees for the sunsets we will never see, and I will celebrate the ones we do. When your hands are cold, I will warm them. When your heart is heavy, I will carry part of that weight. When you are brilliant and bright and the world finally notices, I will clap the loudest. <br>
  <br> Beyond words and beyond the small measures of time we keep, I give you this: a life of patient tending, of faithful mornings and steady nights, of laughter offered freely and refuge given without question. I will learn the maps of your heart so I can find you when the roads grow confusing; I will collect the broken pieces of our hard days and sew them with care until they are whole again. <br>
  <br> I will keep your secrets safe like precious stones. I will speak kindly of you in places where your name cannot defend itself. I will guard your confidence with the reverence I reserve for the rarest things. I will challenge you, not to fracture you, but to ask you to grow into the person you already are in the private places of your heart. I will celebrate your independence even as I celebrate our togetherness, because loving you fully includes loving you freely. <br>
  <br> You are seen, you are chosen, you are loved.<br><br> Let the seasons come and go and let the shapes of our lives change; I will remain — a constant hand, a willing shoulder, a voice that remembers your name even when you cannot.
  This is my promise: to be here, fully and without reservation, for every small ordinary miracle and every fierce storm, for every becoming you are and every rest you need — always, always beside you. <br>
 <br> And if forever should stretch beyond the years we are given, know that my love will not end at the boundaries of time. It will live in every echo of your laughter, in the quiet corners of the world we touched together, in the gentle rhythm of memories that refuse to fade. My devotion is not confined to this moment, nor to this lifetime — it is an inheritance I leave to the universe, a story written in the stars, a prayer whispered into eternity.

You are not simply the love of my life; you are the axis upon which my world turns, the sacred constant in the chaos of all else. With you, I have learned that love is not just a feeling but a sanctuary, a place to rest when the world grows cold, a fire to warm the soul when everything else is dark. You are that fire, and I vow never to let its light falter.

And so I give you not only the words of my heart but the hours of my days, the strength of my hands, the tenderness of my care. I give you my silence when you need peace, and my voice when you need encouragement. I give you the certainty that no matter how heavy the weight of life may become, you will never have to carry it alone.

In the end, if our love is measured by the small courageous acts we perform each day, then I am certain we will have created something that outlasts both of us.

If the world should ever doubt us, let them look at the way I hold you — not with desperation, but with reverence; not as though you are mine to possess, but as though you are a wonder entrusted to me, a miracle to cherish. And in every tomorrow, in every uncertain dawn, I will choose you again — willingly, joyfully, endlessly. 

Forevermore,
<br> Samia
